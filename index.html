    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">I would advise to using a sanitize-html package for sanitizing HTML code to ensure that the data a system accepts is in the right format. Take time to reaserch third-party application so that you can be sure they can be trusted and have been tested by others. Find a safe and reaserched network hosting platform that can be trusted. Instruct the web server to use HTTPS which encrypts data sent between client and server. Make the user create a strong password and use two-factor authentication when the user logges into the site. Have a automatic user timeout so that the user is logged out automatic after a while and then their credentials is not hanging in the browser. Use vulnerability scanner tools to see if you have made any mistakes that might be a securtiy problem. Use continuous deployment/continuous integration to integrate and deliver code to production because it runs a security check and if it does not pass the checkspoints it will be flagged for rework.</p>
